This package is meant to be installed in a user directory.
Unpacking the tarball should create a directory named heegaard.

After unpacking:

cd heegaard

To compile:

cd src
make
make clean
cd ..

To run:

./heegaard


The executable will appear in the top level directory (heegaard) which
was created when you unpacked the tarball.  The program must be run
from this directory, in order for it to find its help files.  Also,
this will ensure that the log files which are written for each session
will be in the heegaard directory.
